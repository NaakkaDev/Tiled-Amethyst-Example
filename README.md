# Simple [rs-tiled](https://github.com/mattyhall/rs-tiled) [Amethyst](https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst) Example

This example shows a simple way to draw a (TMX) map made with [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) in a Amethyst project.

## Notes:
The tileset in `resources/assets/terrainTiles_default.png` is from [Kenney](https://kenney.nl/)

The `resources/assets/tiled_base64_zlib.tmx` map file is made with Tiled version 1.3.3 and the tileset is included in it with the "Embed in map" option being selected.
